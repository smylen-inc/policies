# 16. Vulnerability Scanning Policy

Smylen is proactive about information security and understands that vulnerabilities need to be monitored on an ongoing basis. Smylen utilizes [AWS Inspector](https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/) and GitHub to consistently scan, identify, and address vulnerabilities. We also utilize [AWS GuardDuty](https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/) for integrity checking and intrusion detection.

## 16.1 Applicable Standards

## 16.1.1 Applicable Standards from the HITRUST Common Security Framework

* 10.m - Control of Technical Vulnerabilities

## 16.1.2 Applicable Standards from the HIPAA Security Rule

* 164.308(a)(8) - HIPAA Security Rule Evaluation

## 16.2 Vulnerability Scanning Policy

1. AWS Inspector management is performed by the Smylen Security Officer, or an authorized delegate of the Security Officer.
2. AWS Inspector is used to monitor all internal IP addresses (servers, VMs, etc) on Smylen networks.
3. Frequency of scanning is as follows:
  1. on a weekly basis;
  2. after every production deployment.
4. Reviewing AWS Inspector reports and findings, as well as any further investigation into discovered vulnerabilities, is the responsibility of the Smylen Security Officer. The process for reviewing AWS Inspector reports is outlined below:
  1. The Security Officer initiates the review of a AWS Inspector Report by creating an Issue in the Smylen Task Management System.
  2. The Security Officer, or a Smylen Security Engineer assigned by the Security Officer, is assigned to review the AWS Inspector Report.
  3. If new vulnerabilities are found during review, the process outlined below is used to test those vulnerabilities. Once those steps are completed, the Issue is then reviewed again.
  4. Once the review is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review.
  5. If the review is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.
5. In the case of new vulnerabilities, the following steps are taken:
  * All new vulnerabilities are verified manually to assure they are repeatable. Those not found to be repeatable are manually tested after the next vulnerability scan, regardless of if the specific vulnerability is discovered again.
  * Vulnerabilities that are repeatable manually are documented and reviewed by the Security Officer and Privacy Officer to see if they are part of the current risk assessment performed by Smylen.
    * Those that are a part of the current risk assessment are checked for mitigations.
    * Those that are not part of the current risk assessment trigger a new risk assessment, and this process is outlined in detail in the Smylen Risk Assessment Policy.
6. All vulnerability scanning reports are retained for 6 years by Smylen. Vulnerability report review is monitored on a quarterly basis using the Task Management System reporting to assess compliance with above policy.
7. Penetration testing is performed regularly as part of the Smylen vulnerability management policy.
  * External penetration testing is performed annually by a third party.
  * Internal penetration testing is performed quarterly. Below is the process used to conduct internal penetration tests.
      1. The Security Officer initiates the penetration test by creating an Issue in the Smylen Task Management System.
      2. The Security Officer, or a Smylen Security Engineer assigned by the Security Officer, is assigned to conduct the penetration test.
      3. Gaps and vulnerabilities identified during penetration testing are reviewed, with plans for correction and/or mitigation, by the Smylen Security Officer before the Issue can move to be approved.
      4. Once the testing is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further testing and review.
      5. If the Issue is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.
  * Penetration tests results are retained for 6 years by Smylen.
  * Internal penetration testing is monitored on an annual basis using the Task Management System reporting to assess compliance with above policy.
8. This vulnerability policy is reviewed on a quarterly basis by the Security Officer and Privacy Officer.
